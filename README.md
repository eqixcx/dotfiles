it is based on the i3-gaps desktop environment

the included 'installdeps.sh' script also installs many utilities i use on my personal machine, please read through the script before running it on your machine to ensure you are okay with installing all of the packages included in the script

*TODO*

### Troubleshooting

##### Rofi Setup
When you reach the Rofi setup, you will be prompted to choose between 1080p and 768p, obviously a lot of people have other display formats and resolutions, so if one doesn't work for you, try the other.

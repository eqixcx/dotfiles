# dotfiles

these are my dotfiles for arch linux

it is based on the i3-gaps desktop environment

i most likely won't provide much support for this as "it works enough for me" so i don't really have any other reason to work on it more or fix potential bugs, but if theres anything major i'll fix it to the best of my ability.

the included 'installdeps.sh' script also installs many utilities i use on my personal machine, please read through the script before running it on your machine to ensure you are okay with installing all of the packages included in the script

## Troubleshooting

#### Rofi Setup
When you reach the Rofi setup, you will be prompted to choose between 1080p and 768p, obviously a lot of people have other display formats and resolutions, so if one doesn't work for you, try the other.
